## My process
I wanted to try the mobile first worfklow, as i think it was a good fit for this project. 
This time i tried using the figma design documents to check the different paddings, margins and image sizes, so that i can use them in my own style.css sheet to get as close as possible to the original design.

Feedback that was given to me on a prior challenge has flown into this project. Even though this was simpler than the recepie challenge. I got to learn about semantic html markup and to not use px as units for font sizes.

Also this time i tried using variables for the different colors that have been given. Makes it a lot easier to get closer to the design itself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not particular very proud of this code snippet, but i got to use a css tool that made it very easy to generate dropdown shadow. Felt really nice, to interactively create what you need.

```css
.card{
    /* card properties like width and height taken from figma design file */
    max-width: 320px;
    max-height: 499px;
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    padding: 16px;
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow:0px 10px 40px #6e6e6e2d;
}
```


### Continued development

One major topic i want to focus on is how to correctly layout the website while keeping it responsive. Even though the 'display: flex' etc. seem to have helped in recreating the original design, i am still not exactly sure how to use it. 

Also i need to gain more knowledge on the basics of the html structure. Since these are starter challenges i am sure there's plenty ahead of me to learn over time.

Oh yes, font families are also still some weird construct in my head. So that's something else i need to get into more and more.

Big thanks to "Grace-Snow" for providing detailed feedback on the recepie page project that i was able to learn from.
